# Simulation and Control of Industrial Process with Programmable Logic Controller
This is the repository of my Master's thesis, which I submit at the University of Szeged.

The documentation is in Hungarian and, unlike the title, doesn't provide insights into PLC programming. Instead, it presents an application of [BORIS](https://www.kahlert.com/engl/simulationssystem-boris/) that can be used to simulate an industrial process. Because BORIS is not specifically designed for this purpose, it also provides a solution to make more efficient use of its **CO3715-1H** I/O interface. However, since the CO3715-1H is no longer available, it also introduces its replacement electronics.
